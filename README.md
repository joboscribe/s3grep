# About
A pretty simple tool to search for text in objects stored in AWS's S3. 
# Usage
## Installation
To install you can simply:
```
go get github.com/joboscribe/s3grep
```
Then inside the source directory:
```
go install
```
Now (assuming your `GOPATH` is in your `PATH`) you should be able to run `s3grep`.
## AWS Credentials
Since this is built on the AWS SDK it will use credentials in the same order of preference as laid out in the [SDK documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html). I've tested it with environment variables and a credentials file as generated by running `aws configure`.
## Options and Arguments
```
s3grep [-ike] [--ignore-case] [--keep=path] [--regexp=pattern] [pattern] [bucket] [key] [region]
```
The only required arguments are:
1. `pattern`: a regex that object contents will be matched against (should be in quotes)
2. `bucket`: the name of the bucket containing the objects to be search
3. `key`: a regex used to find objects in which the search will be performed (you can avoid shell expansion by putting this in quotes)
4. `region`: the AWS region where the bucket is located

The optional arguments and flags are:
* `-i` or `--ignore-case`: performs a case-insensitive match
* `-k [path]` or `--keep [path]`: objects containing matches will be stored locally at the file path indicated by `[path]`
* `-e [pattern]` or `--regexp [pattern]`: addition regex that will be matched against, can be used multiple times
## Examples
Let's say you want to search for the string `"super-duper"` in all the objects in the bucket named `my-wonderful-secret-stuff` in the `us-east-1` region:
```
s3grep "super-duper" my-wonderful-secret-stuff ".*" us-east-1
```
Then you realize that there are photos and mp3s and various other file formats in that bucket so you cancel that search and perform it again but this time only in objects with keys ending in `.txt`:
```
s3grep "super-duper" my-wonderful-secret-stuff ".*\.txt" us-east-1
```
Then you realize that you wanted to find all occurrences of `"super-duper"` regardless of case:
```
s3grep -i "super-duper" my-wonderful-secret-stuff ".*\.txt" us-east-1
```
Suddenly you remember that you want not just `"super-duper"` but also `"awesome-possum"`:
```
s3grep -i -e "awesome-possum" "super-duper" my-wonderful-secret-stuff ".*\.txt" us-east-1
```
And that's when you think maybe it'd be a good idea to hang onto all those matching objects locally in your `~/literature` directory so you can read them at your leisure:
```
s3grep -i -k "~/literature" -e "awesome-possum" "super-duper" my-wonderful-secret-stuff ".*\.txt" us-east-1
```
## Possible FAQs
Q: Why would anyone be searching inside text files stored on S3?

A: Maybe you work at a company that uses S3 to store things like, oh, i don't know, logs or digitized documents, and now you need to find all the files containing certain entries. I've had to do almost exactly that, hence my inspiration to create this tool.


Q: Is using this going to cost me money?

A: Probably, i mean, almost assuredly this is going to cost you something, though you would have to consult the S3 pricing guide to get an estimate of how much. I figure one `GET` request per 1,000 objects in the bucket in order to get a list of all the relevant keys and then at least one `GET` request per relevant key. The math is left as an exercise for the reader.


Q: Little presumptuous, don't you think, naming your work after the venerable `grep`?

A: I know right? Believe me, i don't feel entirely comfortable with it, but i decided to go with that name and then try to make it look and behave as similarly as possible even though there are some obvious differences since `grep` doesn't need to know things like "region" or "bucket".


Q: OMGOSH it's taking _forever_! 

A: Lots of big files, huh? Bummer. In terms of improvements there are certainly some low-hanging fruit, which i plan to address (grab? pick?). In the meantime, i guess it makes for a good excuse for the user to go get something to drink, do a little burst of exercise, read an article or what have you.
